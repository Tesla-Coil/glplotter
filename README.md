# glplotter

glplotter draws graphs. It can generate graphs of various functions (you can specify any mathematical expression as function expression, e.g. "sin(x) + x^2"). It can also load a graph from a file.

This repository also includes `gen_function`, a command-line program that generates graph file from given function expression.
